              Hello! My name is Tony, and I am a software engineer currently focusing on web development. I enjoy creating
              things that live on the internet. My interest in web development started back in 2013, when I decided to try creating websites.
            </p>
            <p>
              My experience in software engineering has given me the skills and knowledge necessary to design, develop, and deploy software applications that meet the needs of businesses across a variety of industries.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have recently launched a YouTube channel where I provide comprehensive tutorials on using Vue, Node, Laravel, and other technologies to create, test, and deploy high-quality web applications. These tutorials cover everything from basic concepts to advanced techniques, ensuring that viewers have the knowledge and skills necessary to develop sophisticated applications. As a result of my expertise in web application development, I am confident that I would be a valuable addition 
              to any software engineering team looking to create innovative, user-friendly applications that meet the needs of today's businesses.
            </p>
            <p>Here are a few technologies Iâ€™ve been working with recently:</p>
