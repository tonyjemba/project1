              Hello! My name is Tony and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet. My interest in web
              development started back in 2010 when I
              decided to try creating websites. I really enjoy this work.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fast-forward to today, and I’ve had the privilege of working at a start-up, a huge corporation, and
              a student-led design studio. My main focus these days is building accessible, inclusive products and
              digital experiences
              at Upstatement for a variety of clients.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also recently created a youtube channel where I teach everything you need to know about making web apps
              with the Vue related technologies Node & Laravel.
            </p>
            <p>Here are a few technologies I’ve been working with recently:</p>
